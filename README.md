## Why study Algorithms and Data Structures

Computer scientists learn by experience. We learn by seeing others solve problems and by 
solving problems by ourselves. Being exposed to different problem-solving techniques and 
seeing how different algorithms are designed helps us to take on the next challenging problem 
that we are given. By considering a number of different algorithms, we can begin to develop 
pattern recognition so that the next time a similar problem arises, we are better able to 
solve it.

There will often be trade-offs that we will need to identify and decide upon. As computer 
scientists, in addition to our ability to solve problems, we will also need to know and 
understand solution evaluation techniques. In the end, there are often many ways to solve 
a problem. Finding a solution and then deciding whether it is a good one are tasks that 
we will do over and over again.
